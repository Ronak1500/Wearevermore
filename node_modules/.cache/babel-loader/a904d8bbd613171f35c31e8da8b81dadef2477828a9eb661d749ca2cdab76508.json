Made-to-measure garments are personally tailored to the Customer\\u2019s specifications and cannot be re-sold. Swishbydolcyandsimran is, therefore, unable to accept any cancellation of an order for a made-to-measure item. Swishbydolcyandsimran will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate any change to an existing order required by a Customer, but cannot guarantee to be able to do so, and reserves the right to make an additional charge to the customer for any changes. Items purchased from Swishbydolcyandsimran are non-exchangeable and non-refundable. Please note, the garment(s) purchased are hand embroidered and hand-finished. Due to the complex nature of the garment, embellishments may disintegrate from the fabric. This is not a manufacturing fault. Also, other fabrics such as chiffon and georgette are subject to pulls and rips as is the nature of the garment. Made-to-measure items and their alterations are custom-made items to which the distance selling provisions of The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) 2013 Regulations 2013 are not applicable. Orders for alterations to ready-made garments cannot be canceled and any variation to an alteration order may be subject to an additional charge. Should Swishbydolcyandsimran agree, in its absolute discretion, to accept a cancellation, it reserves the right to make a cancellation charge to the Customer. In the event of any dispute as to whether a finished made-to-measure item or alteration to a ready-made item conforms with the Customer\\u2019s requirements, the description recorded on the Swishbydolcyandsimran Order or Measurement Slip shall be considered final. Kindly note, the accuracy of measurements submitted to Swishbydolcyandsimran by the Customer will be entirely at the Customer\\u2019s own risk. Swishbydolcyandsimran cannot guarantee the delivery of a finished made-to-measure garment to the Customer within any particular time, but will normally deliver within 4 weeks of accepting the Customer\\u2019s order. Please note, ownership of any garment shall not pass to the Customer until paid for in full. SAFETY OF GARMENTS The garment should be kept in a separate cover when not in use and should not be in contact with any other garment, as direct contact with another embroidered outfit may damage it. The garment must be kept out of contact with water and perfumes as they may cause discoloration. The garment must be Dry Cleaned by a reputed dry cleaner company only.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 15,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 11,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"br\", {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 37,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"br\", {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 38,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Footer, {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 39,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 7,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n_c = TandC;\nexport default TandC;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"TandC\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","Header","Footer","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","TandC","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","style","width","marginLeft","textAlign","fontSize","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["C:/Users/windows10/Desktop/Essentail/frontend/src/Pages/TandC.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\r\nimport Header from './Header'\r\nimport Footer from './Footer'\r\n\r\nfunction TandC() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n        <Header/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n      <br/>\r\n      <div style={{ width: \"80%\", marginLeft: \"10%\", textAlign: \"center\" }}>\r\n        <b style={{fontSize:40}}>Video Call Appointment</b>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <label style={{textAlign:\"justify\"}}>\r\n        The following are the terms and conditions which apply to the sales of made-to-measure and Ready Made garments and also to alterations to ready-made garments, purchased from Swishbydolcyandsimran  by the customers.\r\n\r\nMade-to-measure garments are personally tailored to the Customer’s specifications and cannot be re-sold.
